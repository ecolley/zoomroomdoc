## Introduction

This manual provides guidance for using the Zoom Room in our meeting room. If you're familiar with regular Zoom meetings, you'll find that Zoom Rooms work similarly but with some key differences in how meetings are scheduled and started.

**What's Changed:**
- **Before**: Hook up your laptop, share screen manually, manage audio/video on your device
- **Now**: Walk into the room, start the meeting directly on the room system

## What is a Zoom Room?

A Zoom Room is a dedicated meeting space with:
- A controller (tablet or PC) to manage meetings
- Connected display(s) for video and content sharing
- Integrated audio system (microphone and speakers)
- Camera for video conferencing

**Key Difference**: Unlike regular Zoom meetings where you join from your laptop, the Zoom Room itself joins the meeting. You control it using:
1. The Zoom Room Controller (in-room device)
2. The Zoom Room Controller App on your Windows PC

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Zoom Desktop App**: Ensure you have the latest Zoom desktop app installed on your Windows PC
2. **Zoom Room Controller App**: Install this add-on from the Zoom app
   - Open Zoom Desktop App → Click your profile icon → Settings → Add-ons
   - Enable "Zoom Room Controller"
3. **Network Access**: Be on the WFA network or VPN

### First Time Setup

1. Launch the Zoom Room Controller App on your Windows PC
2. Sign in with your WFA Zoom credentials
3. The app will discover available Zoom Rooms on your network
4. Select the WFA meeting room from the list

## Scheduling Meetings for the Zoom Room

Since our Zoom Room calendar integration is set to "None", you have two main options for scheduling:

### Option 1: Schedule as a Regular Zoom Meeting (Recommended)

This is the simplest approach and works well when the organizer will be present:

1. **Create the meeting in Outlook as usual**
   - Open Outlook Calendar
   - Create a new meeting
   - Add attendees
   - Use the Zoom add-in to "Add a Zoom Meeting" (this adds the Zoom meeting link)

2. **On meeting day**: Simply join the meeting from the Zoom Room instead of your laptop
   - The meeting exists in Zoom's system
   - Anyone can join from the Zoom Room using the Meeting ID

**Pros**:
- Familiar workflow
- Works with existing meetings
- No changes to invitation process

**Cons**:
- Requires manual step to join from Zoom Room
- Meeting doesn't automatically appear on Zoom Room display

### Option 2: Use Personal Meeting ID (PMI)

For recurring meetings or when you want a consistent meeting room:

1. Use your Personal Meeting ID in the Zoom Room
2. Attendees join your PMI as usual
3. You control the meeting from the Zoom Room

## Starting a Meeting in the Zoom Room

### Method 1: Using the In-Room Controller

1. **Wake up the controller** (tap the screen)
2. **Choose one of these options**:
   - **"Start Instant Meeting"**: Starts a new meeting immediately
   - **"Join"**: Enter a Meeting ID to join an existing meeting
   - **"Share Screen"**: Start sharing content wirelessly

3. **Share the meeting details** with participants
   - Meeting ID and password will display on screen
   - Participants join using their regular Zoom app

### Method 2: Using Zoom Room Controller App (From Your Desk)

1. **Open Zoom Room Controller App** on your Windows PC
2. **Select the WFA meeting room**
3. **Start or Join**:
   - Click "Start Meeting" to begin an instant meeting in the room
   - Click "Join Meeting" and enter the Meeting ID
4. **Walk to the meeting room** - the meeting will already be running

**Advantage**: You can set up the meeting before walking to the room, saving time.

## Joining an Existing Meeting

### For Scheduled Meetings

Since we're not using calendar integration, follow these steps:

1. **Get the Meeting ID** from your Outlook invitation
   - Look for the Zoom meeting link or Meeting ID in the email

2. **At the Zoom Room**:
   - Tap "Join" on the controller
   - Enter the Meeting ID
   - Enter the password if required
   - Tap "Join Meeting"

3. **Or use the Zoom Room Controller App**:
   - Open the app on your PC
   - Select the WFA meeting room
   - Enter the Meeting ID and join
   - Walk to the meeting room

### Converting Laptop-Based Meetings to Zoom Room

For meetings already scheduled on your laptop:

1. **Before the meeting**: Note the Meeting ID from your Zoom invitation
2. **At meeting time**: Instead of joining on your laptop, join from the Zoom Room using the Meeting ID
3. **Optional**: Keep your laptop connected for backup or to share your screen if needed

## Delegation and Remote Control

### When the Organizer Cannot Attend

**Scenario**: You've organized a meeting but won't be there. Someone else needs to host it from the Zoom Room.

**Solution 1: Make Someone Else a Co-Host (Best Practice)**

1. Before the meeting, join briefly from your laptop
2. When attendees join, make the designated person a co-host:
   - Hover over their name in participants list
   - Click "More" → "Make Co-Host"
3. They can now control the meeting from the Zoom Room
4. Leave the meeting from your laptop

**Solution 2: Assign Alternative Hosts in Advance**

1. When scheduling in Outlook with Zoom:
   - Click "Advanced Options" in the Zoom meeting settings
   - Add alternative hosts by email
2. Alternative hosts can start the meeting without you

**Solution 3: Transfer Host During Meeting**

1. If you're in the meeting (on laptop or Zoom Room):
   - Participants list → hover over the person's name
   - Click "More" → "Make Host"
2. You can then leave

### Controlling the Zoom Room Remotely

**From Your Desk**:
1. Open Zoom Room Controller App
2. Select the WFA meeting room
3. You can:
   - Start/end meetings
   - Adjust volume
   - View what's on the display
   - Invite participants

**While in the Room**:
- Use the physical controller (tablet/touch panel)
- Anyone in the meeting can use the controller

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Can't see the Zoom Room in the Controller App
- **Solution**: Ensure you're on the WFA network
- Check that the Zoom Room is powered on (display should be active)
- Restart the Zoom Room Controller App

**Problem**: No audio during meeting
- **Solution**: Check volume on the in-room controller
- Ensure "Mute" is not enabled (check the controller screen)
- Test with "Test Speaker" option in settings

**Problem**: Attendees can't hear people in the room
- **Solution**: Check the microphone mute button on the controller
- Verify the microphone light is active
- Move closer to the microphone if needed

**Problem**: Can't share screen from laptop
- **Solution**: Use "Share Screen" feature on the controller
- Follow the on-screen instructions (usually requires entering a sharing code in your Zoom app)
- Alternative: Join the meeting on your laptop as well and share from there

**Problem**: Meeting didn't start automatically
- **Solution**: This is expected - we're not using calendar integration
- Manually start or join the meeting using the Meeting ID

**Problem**: Wrong meeting is showing on screen
- **Solution**: End the current meeting on the controller
- Start/join the correct meeting using the Meeting ID

## Tips & Tricks

### Best Practices

**For Meeting Organizers**:
- Arrive 5 minutes early to set up the Zoom Room
- Have your Meeting ID ready before entering the room
- Test audio/video before attendees join
- Consider using the Zoom Room Controller App to start the meeting before walking to the room

- Use "Raise Hand" feature for organized Q&A sessions
- Record meetings to the cloud if needed (enables automatic transcription)

### Advanced Features

**Screen Sharing**:

- **From Your Laptop in the Room**:
  - Click "Share Screen" on the room controller
  - Follow the pairing code instructions
  - OR: Join the meeting on your laptop as a participant and share screen

**Recording**:
- As host, click "Record" on the controller or in your Zoom app
- Choose "Record to Cloud" for automatic storage and transcription

**Breakout Rooms**:
- Must be managed from a laptop/desktop Zoom app, not the Zoom Room controller
- Join the meeting on your laptop as well if you need this feature
- Participants in the Zoom Room will be assigned to a breakout room as a group

### Time-Saving Workflows

**Recurring Team Meetings**:
- Use your Personal Meeting ID (PMI) for weekly team meetings
- Team members always join the same ID
- No need to schedule in Outlook if it's internal-only

**Back-to-Back Meetings**:
- Use the Zoom Room Controller App to queue up meetings from your desk
- Walk into a ready-to-go meeting room

**Hybrid Meetings** (Some attendees in room, some remote):
- Start the meeting from the Zoom Room
- In-room participants use the room's camera/mic
- Remote participants join from their devices as usual
- Consider: In-room participants can also join on their laptops (muted) for better chat visibility

### Migrating Existing Meetings

For meetings already scheduled that you want to use with the Zoom Room:

1. **No changes needed to the invitation** - keep the same Meeting ID
2. **Update meeting practices**:
   - Add a note in the Outlook meeting: "Meeting will be hosted from the WFA Zoom Room"
   - First person to arrive joins the meeting from the Zoom Room
3. **For recurring meetings**: Consider updating the series description with Zoom Room instructions

### Efficiency Tips

- **Bookmark**: Save the Zoom Room Controller App to your taskbar for quick access
- **Pre-join**: Use the controller app 2-3 minutes before the meeting to start setup
- **Naming**: If you schedule meetings specifically for the Zoom Room, add [Zoom Room] to the subject line
- **Backup Plan**: Keep your laptop handy for the first few meetings in case of issues
