## Introduction

This manual provides guidance for using the Zoom Room in our meeting room. If you're familiar with regular Zoom meetings, you'll find that Zoom Rooms work similarly but with some key differences in how meetings are scheduled and started.

**What's Changed:**
- **Before**: Hook up your laptop, share screen manually, manage audio/video on your device
- **Now**: Walk into the room, start the meeting directly on the room system

## What is a Zoom Room?

A Zoom Room is a dedicated meeting space with:
- A controller (tablet or PC) to manage meetings
- Connected display(s) for video and content sharing
- Integrated audio system (microphone and speakers)
- Camera for video conferencing

**Key Difference**: Unlike regular Zoom meetings where you join from your laptop, the Zoom Room itself joins the meeting. You control it using:
1. The Zoom Room Controller (in-room device)
2. The Zoom Room Controller App on your Windows PC

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Zoom Desktop App**: Ensure you have the latest Zoom desktop app installed on your Windows PC
2. **Zoom Room Controller App**: Install this add-on from the Zoom app
   - Open Zoom Desktop App → Click your profile icon → Settings → Add-ons
   - Enable "Zoom Room Controller"
3. **Network Access**: Be on the WFA network or VPN

### First Time Setup

1. Launch the Zoom Room Controller App on your Windows PC
2. Sign in with your WFA Zoom credentials (your normal Zoom account)
3. The app will discover available Zoom Rooms on your network
4. Select the WFA meeting room from the list
5. If prompted, enter the pairing code shown on the Zoom Room display

### Who Can Use the Controller App

**Any staff member** with a WFA Zoom account can use the Zoom Room Controller App from their desk - no special permissions required. Simply install the add-on and sign in with your normal credentials.

**What you can control:**
- Start or join meetings
- Adjust volume and mute/unmute
- Share screen
- Invite participants
- View what's on the room display
- End meetings

**What's protected (requires room passcode):**
- Changing Zoom Room settings
- Signing out of the Zoom Room
- Exiting the Zoom Room application

This means you can run meetings from your desk, but only IT admins can modify the room configuration.

## Scheduling Meetings for the Zoom Room

Our Zoom Room is integrated with Microsoft 365 calendar (resource: **zoomroom@wfanet.org**). This means meetings scheduled with the room resource automatically appear on the Zoom Room display for one-tap joining.

### Option 1: Schedule with Calendar Integration (Recommended)

This is the easiest method and provides the best experience:

1. **Create the meeting in Outlook**
   - Open Outlook Calendar
   - Create a new meeting and add attendees
   - Use the Zoom add-in to "Add a Zoom Meeting" (this adds the Zoom meeting link)
   - **Add the Zoom Room as a resource**: Type `zoomroom@wfanet.org` in the Location field or add it as a required attendee
   - Send the invitation

2. **The room resource automatically accepts** the meeting invitation

3. **On meeting day**: Walk into the meeting room
   - Your meeting appears on the Zoom Room display with meeting title and time
   - Tap **"Start Meeting"** on the scheduled meeting
   - Done! No need to enter Meeting IDs

**Pros**:
- One-tap to start meetings
- Meeting appears on room display automatically
- See room schedule at a glance
- Prevents double-booking (Outlook shows room availability)
- Professional and efficient

**Cons**:
- Requires adding the room resource when scheduling (one extra step)
- Existing meetings need to be updated to add the room

### Option 2: Manual Join (Alternative Method)

You can still manually join any Zoom meeting without scheduling it with the room resource:

1. **Get the Meeting ID** from your Outlook invitation or Zoom app

2. **At the Zoom Room**:
   - Tap "Join" on the controller
   - Enter the Meeting ID
   - Enter the password if required
   - Tap "Join Meeting"

**When to use this**:
- Ad-hoc meetings not scheduled in advance
- When you forgot to add the room resource when scheduling
- Joining someone else's meeting that wasn't scheduled for this room

### Option 3: Use Personal Meeting ID (PMI)

For recurring internal meetings or when you want a consistent meeting room:

1. Schedule a recurring meeting in Outlook with your Personal Meeting ID
2. Add `zoomroom@wfanet.org` as a resource
3. The meeting appears on the Zoom Room display for each occurrence
4. Attendees join your PMI as usual

## Starting a Meeting in the Zoom Room

### Method 1: Start a Scheduled Meeting (Easiest)

If you scheduled the meeting with the room resource (zoomroom@wfanet.org):

1. **Walk into the meeting room** at your scheduled time
2. **Look at the Zoom Room display** - your meeting is shown with title and time
3. **Tap "Start Meeting"** on your scheduled meeting
4. Done! The Zoom Room joins your meeting automatically

### Method 2: Using the In-Room Controller (Manual)

For ad-hoc meetings or when the meeting wasn't scheduled with the room:

1. **Wake up the controller** (tap the screen)
2. **Choose one of these options**:
   - **"Start Instant Meeting"**: Starts a new meeting immediately
   - **"Join"**: Enter a Meeting ID to join an existing meeting
   - **"Share Screen"**: Start sharing content wirelessly

3. **Share the meeting details** with participants
   - Meeting ID and password will display on screen
   - Participants join using their regular Zoom app

### Method 3: Using Zoom Room Controller App (From Your Desk)

1. **Open Zoom Room Controller App** on your Windows PC
2. **Select the WFA meeting room**
3. **Start or Join**:
   - If your meeting is scheduled with the room, you'll see it in the app - click to start
   - Click "Start Meeting" to begin an instant meeting in the room
   - Click "Join Meeting" and enter the Meeting ID for meetings not scheduled with the room
4. **Walk to the meeting room** - the meeting will already be running

**Advantage**: You can set up the meeting before walking to the room, saving time.

## Managing Calendar Events for the Zoom Room

### Adding the Room to an Existing Meeting

If you already scheduled a meeting but forgot to add the room resource:

**Option 1: Edit the meeting**
1. Open the meeting in your Outlook Calendar
2. Click "Edit" or open the meeting details
3. Add `zoomroom@wfanet.org` to the Location field or as an attendee
4. Click "Send Update"

3. The room will receive and display the meeting

### Changing a Meeting Time or Details

1. Open the meeting in your Outlook Calendar
2. Make your changes (time, attendees, title, etc.)
3. Click "Send Update"
4. The Zoom Room calendar updates automatically
5. The updated meeting appears on the room display with new details

### Deleting or Cancelling a Meeting

**To cancel a meeting:**
1. Open the meeting in Outlook Calendar
2. Click "Cancel Meeting"
3. Send the cancellation
4. The meeting is automatically removed from the Zoom Room display

**To remove the room from a meeting (keep the meeting, just not in the room):**
1. Open the meeting in Outlook
2. Remove `zoomroom@wfanet.org` from the location or attendees
3. Send Update
4. The meeting disappears from the Zoom Room display (but continues for other attendees)

### Joining an Existing Meeting Without Calendar Integration

For meetings not scheduled with the room resource, or when joining someone else's meeting:

1. **Get the Meeting ID** from your Outlook invitation
   - Look for the Zoom meeting link or Meeting ID in the email

2. **At the Zoom Room**:
   - Tap "Join" on the controller
   - Enter the Meeting ID
   - Enter the password if required
   - Tap "Join Meeting"

3. **Or use the Zoom Room Controller App**:
   - Open the app on your PC
   - Select the WFA meeting room
   - Enter the Meeting ID and join
   - Walk to the meeting room

## When Meetings Run Over Time

### What Happens at the Scheduled End Time

**Important**: When a meeting is scheduled with the room resource (zoomroom@wfanet.org), the Zoom Room displays the scheduled start and end times. However, **the Zoom meeting itself does not automatically disconnect at the scheduled end time.**

Once you start a meeting, it continues until someone manually ends it, regardless of the calendar schedule.

### Typical Behavior

**During the meeting:**
- The meeting runs normally until the scheduled end time
- Participants can continue talking and sharing

**At the scheduled end time:**
- The Zoom Room display may show a notification that the scheduled time has ended
- If another meeting is scheduled next, a warning will appear on screen
- **The meeting does NOT automatically end** - someone must tap "End Meeting"

**If there's a following meeting:**
- The Zoom Room will display notifications about the upcoming meeting
- Warning messages may appear: "Next meeting starts in X minutes"
- The current meeting continues until manually ended

### Best Practices for Time Management

**For Meeting Organizers:**
1. **Watch the time**: Set a timer or reminder to end on schedule
2. **End meetings promptly**: Tap "End Meeting" on the controller when finished
3. **Respect the next booking**: If you need more time and there's no conflict, check the room calendar first
4. **Communicate**: If running over, let participants know you'll need to wrap up

**For Back-to-Back Meetings:**
1. **Schedule buffer time**: Consider ending your meeting 5 minutes before the hour to allow setup time for the next group
2. **Check the schedule**: Look at the Zoom Room display to see if another meeting is scheduled after yours
3. **Be prepared to end promptly**: If another meeting is scheduled, respect their booking time

**If You Need More Time:**
1. **Check the room calendar**: Look at the Zoom Room display to see if the room is free after your scheduled time
2. **In Outlook**: Check if zoomroom@wfanet.org is available for an extended time
3. **Extend your booking**: If the room is free, edit your Outlook meeting to extend the time
4. **Don't assume**: If you haven't extended the booking and another meeting is scheduled, you must end on time

### Handling Meeting Conflicts

**Scenario: Your meeting is running over and the next meeting is starting**

The next meeting organizer will see:
- Your meeting is still active in the room
- Their scheduled meeting on the display but unable to start

**Resolution:**
1. **Current meeting**: Politely end the meeting or move to another space
2. **Next meeting**: Can manually end the previous meeting from the controller if the organizer has left
3. **If uncertain**: Contact the previous meeting organizer or IT support

**Scenario: You arrive and the previous meeting is still running**

1. Wait outside the room briefly (2-3 minutes grace period is courteous)
2. If the meeting clearly shows no signs of ending, politely knock or check if they're aware
3. Check the Zoom Room display - verify your meeting is indeed scheduled
4. As a last resort, if they're significantly over (10+ minutes) and don't respond, you may need to contact IT support

### Configurable Options (Admin Settings)

IT administrators can configure several options in the Zoom admin portal to manage room time:

**Buffer Time Between Meetings:**
- Automatically blocks time between meetings (e.g., 5 or 10 minutes)
- Prevents back-to-back scheduling conflicts
- Gives time for room setup and cleanup

**Check-In Requirements:**
- Next meeting organizer must "check in" within X minutes of scheduled start
- If they don't check in, the current meeting can continue using the room
- Helps prevent wasted bookings when organizers don't show up

**Automatic Meeting Warnings:**
- Displays countdown timers: "Meeting ends in 10 minutes"
- Shows notifications when next meeting is approaching
- Visual reminders on the controller and display

**Release on No-Show:**
- If no one starts a scheduled meeting within X minutes, the booking is released
- Makes the room available for others

**Note**: Check with your IT administrator about which settings are enabled for the WFA Zoom Room.

### Room Etiquette Summary

✅ **DO:**
- End meetings on time or slightly early
- Check the room schedule before extending discussions
- Extend your booking in Outlook if you need more time and the room is free
- Be respectful of the next booking

❌ **DON'T:**
- Assume you can run over without checking the schedule
- Continue meetings significantly past the scheduled end time when another meeting is waiting
- Leave meetings running when you exit the room (always tap "End Meeting")
- Force the next group to wait without acknowledgment

## Delegation and Remote Control

### When the Organizer Cannot Attend

**Scenario**: You've organized a meeting but won't be there. Someone else needs to host it from the Zoom Room.

**Solution 1: Make Someone Else a Co-Host (Best Practice)**

1. Before the meeting, join briefly from your laptop
2. When attendees join, make the designated person a co-host:
   - Hover over their name in participants list
   - Click "More" → "Make Co-Host"
3. They can now control the meeting from the Zoom Room
4. Leave the meeting from your laptop

**Solution 2: Assign Alternative Hosts in Advance**

1. When scheduling in Outlook with Zoom:
   - Click "Advanced Options" in the Zoom meeting settings
   - Add alternative hosts by email
2. Alternative hosts can start the meeting without you

**Solution 3: Transfer Host During Meeting**

1. If you're in the meeting (on laptop or Zoom Room):
   - Participants list → hover over the person's name
   - Click "More" → "Make Host"
2. You can then leave

### Controlling the Zoom Room Remotely

**From Your Desk**:
1. Open Zoom Room Controller App
2. Select the WFA meeting room
3. You can:
   - Start/end meetings
   - Adjust volume
   - View what's on the display
   - Invite participants

**While in the Room**:
- Use the physical controller (tablet/touch panel)
- Anyone in the meeting can use the controller

## Troubleshooting

- **Solution**: Check volume on the in-room controller
- Ensure "Mute" is not enabled (check the controller screen)

**Problem**: Attendees can't hear people in the room
- **Solution**: Check the microphone mute button on the controller
- Verify the microphone light is active
- Move closer to the microphone if needed

- **Solution**: Use "Share Screen" feature on the controller
- Follow the on-screen instructions (usually requires entering a sharing code in your Zoom app)
- Alternative: Join the meeting on your laptop as well and share from there

**Problem**: Meeting didn't start automatically
- **Solution**: Check if the meeting was scheduled with the room resource (zoomroom@wfanet.org)
- If not scheduled with the room, tap "Start Meeting" on the scheduled item or manually join using the Meeting ID

**Problem**: Wrong meeting is showing on screen
- **Solution**: End the current meeting on the controller
- Look for your scheduled meeting on the display and tap "Start"
- Or manually join the correct meeting using the Meeting ID

**Problem**: My meeting doesn't appear on the Zoom Room display
- **Solution**: Check if you added zoomroom@wfanet.org when scheduling
- If not, you can edit the meeting in Outlook and add the room resource
- Or manually join using the Meeting ID (tap "Join" on controller)

**Hybrid Meetings** (Some attendees in room, some remote):
- Start the meeting from the Zoom Room
- In-room participants use the room's camera/mic
- Remote participants join from their devices as usual
- Consider: In-room participants can also join on their laptops (muted) for better chat visibility

### Migrating Existing Meetings

For meetings already scheduled that you want to use with the Zoom Room:

**Option 1: Add the room resource (recommended)**
1. Open the meeting in Outlook Calendar
2. Edit the meeting and add `zoomroom@wfanet.org` as a location or attendee
3. Send Update
4. The meeting now appears on the Zoom Room display for one-tap starting

**Option 2: Keep existing meeting, join manually**
1. **No changes needed to the invitation** - keep the same Meeting ID
2. **On meeting day**: Manually join from the Zoom Room using the Meeting ID
3. **Optional**: Add a note in the meeting description: "Will be hosted from WFA Zoom Room"

**For recurring meetings**: Edit the entire series to add the room resource once, and all future occurrences will appear on the Zoom Room display

### Efficiency Tips

- **Bookmark**: Save the Zoom Room Controller App to your taskbar for quick access
- **Pre-join**: Use the controller app 2-3 minutes before the meeting to start setup
- **Always invite the room**: Make it a habit to add zoomroom@wfanet.org when creating Zoom meetings for the conference room
