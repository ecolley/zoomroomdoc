# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains documentation for managing a Zoom Room setup at WFA company. The goal is to create an operating manual for staff who are regular Zoom users but have not used Zoom Rooms before.

## Context

- **Environment**: Windows workstations with Microsoft 365
- **Current Setup**: Zoom Room with calendar integration set to "None" (may change - see CALENDAR-OPTIONS.md)
- **Users**: Multiple meeting organizers who previously used Outlook invitations and connected laptops to meeting room displays
- **Available Tools**: Zoom Room Controller App (Windows Zoom desktop app addon) - available to all staff
- **Access Control**: Any user with WFA Zoom account can use the Controller App; room passcode protects configuration changes
- **Target Audience**: Staff familiar with Zoom but new to Zoom Rooms

## Key Requirements

The documentation should address:
- How to transition from laptop-based meetings to Zoom Room-based meetings
- Procedures for meeting organizers to use the Zoom Room
- Handling existing meetings that should use the Zoom Room
- Delegation scenarios where the organizer may not attend
- Practical tips and tricks for staff

## Documentation Structure

The repository contains:

- **README.md**: Comprehensive operating manual covering setup, scheduling, joining meetings, delegation scenarios, troubleshooting, and tips & tricks
- **CALENDAR-OPTIONS.md**: Detailed comparison of calendar integration modes (Microsoft 365 vs manual join) with setup instructions and decision framework
- **QUICK-REFERENCE.md**: Printable one-page guide for in-room use with essential commands and quick troubleshooting
- **readmefirst.md**: Initial project requirements and context

Documentation is practical and procedure-focused, written for users who understand Zoom but are learning Zoom Rooms.
