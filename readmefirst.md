Explain how my company (WFA) should manage the Zoom Room we just set up in our meeting room. Until now, a meeting organiser would send out invitations using Outlook. She would then go to the meeting room, hook up her laptop to the big screen and sound system, and run the meeting from that.

There are several meeting organisers. Some of the meetings have already been created by those organisers, but we will want them to happen on the big screen. Also, sometimes the organiser may not actually attend, so I suppose they delegate to another attendee.

Everyone is using Windows and Microsoft 365. I know there is a Zoom Room Controller App as an addon to the Windows Zoom desktop app, and it works.

In setting up the Zoom Room, I was offered the choice between Zoom calendaring, Third-party, or None. I have selected None for the moment.

I am the IT admin, but I rarely use Zoom for meetings - usually Teams, so I am not too familiar with it. The objective of this dialog is to clarify these questions and develop an operating manual for the staff, who are regular Zoom users but have not used Zoom Rooms before. It should cover procedures and perhaps tips & tricks

Let's set this up as a small Github repo, ecolley/zoomroomdoc. All the necessary authentications are already in place, I think.
